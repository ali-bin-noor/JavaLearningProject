package practiceJavaPrograms.sorting.bubbleSort;

/*
* You are given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Explanation:

The array has two 0s, two 1s, and two 2s. Sorting them in-place places all 0s first, then all 1s, then all 2s.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]

Output: [0,1,2]

Explanation:

The array has one each of 0, 1, and 2, arranged in-place in the order 0, 1, 2.
